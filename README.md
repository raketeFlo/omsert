# Omsert

Omsert is a React application with information about the countries of the â€‹Earth for extraterrestrial tourists. The design is for mobile devices only and fully responsive.


## How it works

The app is using the `Rest Countries API` to get the information about each country. You can search for any country in the world and filter the list for it. If you want to get more information about a country, you have to select it. The `Google Maps API` will then render the country on the map and a modal will provide you additional information about it which you can then share via social share with your friends.
